# A Config file would look like the following:

- advent_session_cookie = xyz123
- advent_private_leaderboards = { xyz123, yzx231, zyx321 }
- advent_language_selected = ts

# Issues:

[_] The stats command and private leaderboards
[_] A command to log in again via prompt
[x] How would I run a debugger? (test command)
[_] Refactor submit with the exectuable body to get rid of massive if chains
[_] Fix the @ts-ignored shebang with kfs.default imports
[_] Add a JS template for people doing it in JS
[_] Add a feedback system in files on completion
[_] Actually add proper readmes
[_] Add licenses
