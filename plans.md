# A Config file would look like the following: 
 - advent_session_cookie = xyz123
 - advent_private_leaderboards = { xyz123, yzx231, zyx321 }
 - advent_language_selected = ts

# Issues:
 [_] The stats command and private leaderboards
 [_] A command to log in again via prompt
 [x] How would I run a debugger? (test command)
 [_] Refactor submit with the exectuable body
